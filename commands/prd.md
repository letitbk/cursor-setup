Draft a Product Requirements Document for: $ARGUMENTS

If no topic was provided above (blank after the colon), ask the user what product or feature they want to write a PRD for before proceeding.

## Step 1: Requirements Brainstorming

Before writing, brainstorm thoroughly. Generate and present:
- 3-5 user personas who would interact with this feature/product
- Key problems being solved and why they matter now
- Competitive landscape (what exists today, gaps)
- Technical constraints and dependencies to consider
- Open questions that need stakeholder input

Ask the user to confirm, adjust, or add to these before proceeding.

## Step 2: Write the PRD

Using the confirmed brainstorming output, write a complete PRD with these sections:

1. **Title & Metadata** — Feature name, author, date, status (Draft), version
2. **Problem Statement** — What problem exists, who it affects, quantified impact
3. **Goals & Non-Goals** — Explicit success outcomes and what is deliberately excluded
4. **User Stories** — "As a [persona], I want [action] so that [outcome]." Minimum 5 stories.
5. **Requirements** — Functional (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have) and non-functional
6. **Success Metrics** — KPIs with baseline, target, and measurement method
7. **User Flow** — Step-by-step primary happy path
8. **Edge Cases & Error Handling** — What can go wrong, how the system responds
9. **Dependencies & Risks** — External dependencies, risks, mitigation plans
10. **Timeline & Milestones** — Phased rollout with deliverables per phase
11. **Open Questions** — Unresolved items requiring stakeholder decisions

Save the PRD as `PRD-{topic-slug}.md` in the current working directory.
